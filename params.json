{"name":"mpFormulaC","tagline":"A library for multiprecision arithmetic in C","body":"### Welcome to mpFormulaPy.\r\nThe mpFormulaPy library is based on the [Python](https://www.python.org/) runtime and the [mpmath](http://mpmath.org/) library, both of which implement multiprecision arithmetic. Additional functionality includes integration in [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) (Windows)  and [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (Windows, Mac OSX, GNU/Linux), with multiprecision support for the numerical functions of these spreadsheet programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\nThe manual is also available separately as pdf file: [mpFormulaPy.pdf](https://github.com/mpFormula/Py/raw/master/Manual/mpFormula.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick start under Windows.\r\nSystem requirements: Windows (Desktop) with [.NET Framework 4.x (Full)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718).\r\n\r\nDownload the ZIP file and unzip it into a directory for which you have write access.\r\nWithin the unzipped directory double-click on `mpFormula.bat`. This will start the Python Console of the  [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) IDE.\r\nTo confirm that mpFormulaPy is working, type the following within the Python Console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from mpFormulaPy import *\r\n>>> pi\r\n﻿mpf('3.141592653589793238462643402')\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\nStill in the Sharpdevelop IDE, click on `Tools -> mpFormulaPy Manual`, to open the manual in your default pdf viewer.\r\n\r\nWithin the manual, navigate to `Getting Started - Tutorials`, and follow the examples.\r\nYou can copy and paste the Python code of the examples from the manual into the Python Console.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick start with Microsoft Excel (Windows)\r\nTo use the mpFormulaPy functions from within Excel, you need to install the mpFormulaPy add-in for Excel.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick start with LibreOffice Calc (Windows, Mac OSX, GNU/Linux)\r\nTo use the mpFormulaPy functions from within LibreOffice Calc, you need to install the mpFormulaPy add-in for LibreOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe mpFormulaPy Library and Toolbox is free software.
