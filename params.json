{"name":"mpFormulaC","tagline":"A library for multiprecision arithmetic in C","body":"### Welcome to mpFormulaC!\r\nThe mpFormulaC library provides a comprehensive set of number-theoretical functions, and elementary and special real and complex functions in multiprecision ball arithmetic. It is based on a number of well-established libraries, which implement or support multiprecision, interval, or ball arithmetic: [GMP](https://gmplib.org/), [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/), [FLINT](http://flintlib.org/), [ARB](http://fredrikj.net/arb/), [libmpdec](http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/), [MPFRC++](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/), [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), [Boost Math Toolkit](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/math/doc/html/index.html) and [Boost Random](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/doc/html/boost_random.html). Additional planned functionality includes integration in  [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (Windows, Mac OSX, GNU/Linux), with multiprecision support for the numerical functions of this spreadsheet program.\r\nThe library is currently still in pre-alpha stage, and much of the planned functionality is still missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\nThe manual is also available separately as pdf file: [mpFormulaC.pdf](https://github.com/mpFormula/C/raw/master/Manual/mpFormulaC.pdf). Like the library itself, the manual is still very incomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick start under Windows.\r\nSystem requirements: Windows (Desktop) with [.NET Framework 4.x (Full)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718).\r\n\r\nDownload the .zip file and unzip it into a directory for which you have write access.\r\nWithin the unzipped directory double-click on `mpFormulaC.bat`. This will start the Python Console of the  [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) IDE.\r\nTo confirm that mpFormulaC is working, type the following within the Python Console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> from mpFormulaC import *\r\n>>> pi\r\nï»¿mpf('3.141592653589793238462643402')\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\nStill in the Sharpdevelop IDE, click on `Tools -> mpFormulaC Manual`, to open the manual in your default pdf viewer.\r\n\r\nWithin the manual, navigate to `Getting Started - Tutorials`, and follow the examples.\r\nYou can copy and paste the Python code of the examples from the manual into the Python Console.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick start with LibreOffice Calc (Windows, Mac OSX, GNU/Linux)\r\nTo use the mpFormulaC functions from within LibreOffice Calc, you need to install the mpFormulaC add-in for LibreOffice (see the manual for details).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nThe site [\"Numerical Explorations\"](https://duhadler.wordpress.com/) contains background information related to Python and Verified Computing in general, and mpFormulaC in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe mpFormulaC Library and Toolbox is free software.
